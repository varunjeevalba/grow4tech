        <img height="230" width="600" src="zpoint.jpg" alt="zpoint">
        <p>At a distance of 5 km from Kemmanagundi, 67 km from Chikmagalur and 1 km from Shanti Falls, Z Point is a
            wonderful trekking spot and one of the prime places to visit in Kemmanagundi. Z Point is a beautiful spot
            with deep valleys all around amidst thick green surroundings. The cool breeze on the peak mesmerizes
            visitors. It is one of the best short treks in Karnataka with beautiful views of nature and valleys. <br>

            The 3 km trekking trail to Z Point starts from Kemmanagundi Raj Bhavan and runs through thick forest. Shanti
            Waterfalls is situated enroute to the Z Point. The trek is relatively easy till Shanti Hills and gets little
            tough afterwards. The later part of the trek runs through narrow path with deep gorges and steep hills. The
            trek route provides breathtaking views of the hills of Kemmanagundi. The wide and beautiful grasslands
            provide unique setting to the slopes. <br>

            The Z Point is a great sunset & sunrise point. The trek from Raj Bhavan to Z Point usually takes about 1
            hour. Camping at the Z Point is possible.
